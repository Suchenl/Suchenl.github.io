# 😊 About Me
I am a first-year M.S. student at the School of Cyber Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), where I am advised by Professor [Weiming Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eTCfl6cAAAAJ&hl=en) ([张卫明](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~zhangwm/)) and Professor [Nenghai Yu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7620QAMAAAAJ&hl=en) ([俞能海](http://faculty.ustc.edu.cn/yunenghai/zh_CN/index.htm)). Previously, I completed my Bachelor's degree at the School of Control Science and Engineering at Shandong University. My research is primarily focused on the intersection of artificial intelligence, computer vision, and security. My research interests include:

- AIGC (AI-Generated Content)
- CV (Computer Vision)
- Information Hiding
- AI Safety
- AI for Medicine

I am enthusiastic about discussing novel ideas and collaborations. If you have access to large-scale computational resources and are looking for a passionate collaborator to research interesting problems, please feel free to email me!

# 📖 Educations
- *2025.09 - Present*, School of Cyber Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China
- *2021.09 - 2025.06*, School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong University

# 💬 Invited Reviewers
- *2025.08*, The 40th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2026)
- *2024*, Biomedical Signal Processing and Control (BSPC)

# 💻 Internships
- *2025.05 - 2025.08*, Algorithm Intern, [Onestory Team](https://ad.yiban.io/operate/tool/1189)

    - Pioneered the development and deployment of **LAMIC** (Layout-Aware Multi-Image Composition), an advanced algorithm for multi-image layout and composition.
    
    - The LAMIC algorithm was integrated into Onestory’s core product and internal content creation pipelines, significantly enhancing automated image generation capabilities. The associated research paper was accepted by **AAAI 2026**.

    - Conducted fine-tuning and optimization of advanced Text-to-Image (T2I) and Image-to-Image (I2I) generative models (e.g., using LoRA/Flux-Kontext/EasyControl) to meet specific product requirements, with models currently in production within the team’s content tools.

- *2024.10 - 2025.05*, Research Assistant, [Weiming Group](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~zhangwm/index.html), USTC

    Focused on AIGC security by developing the **TAG-WM** algorithm for tamper localization and copyright protection in generative images, resulting in a paper accepted by the top conference in computer vision, **ICCV 2025**.
